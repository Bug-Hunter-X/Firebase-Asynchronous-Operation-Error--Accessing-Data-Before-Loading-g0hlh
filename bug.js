The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This can happen if you use asynchronous operations without properly handling promises or async/await.  For example:

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().myField); //Error if data is not yet loaded
});
```
This will cause an error if `myField` hasn't finished loading.  Another common issue is using `doc.exists` before the promise resolves, resulting in a false negative.
