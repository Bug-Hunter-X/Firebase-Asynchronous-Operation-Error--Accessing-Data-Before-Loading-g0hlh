# Firebase Asynchronous Operation Error: Accessing Data Before Loading

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when dealing with asynchronous operations: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has completely loaded. This often results in unexpected errors, particularly when using promises or async/await incorrectly.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file showcases how attempting to access data from a Firebase document snapshot prematurely leads to errors.  The solution is detailed in `bugSolution.js`.

## Solution

The solution file demonstrates proper handling of asynchronous operations in Firebase, ensuring data is fully loaded before access.  It utilizes `async/await` for clearer error handling and code readability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project (requires a Firebase project and credentials).
4. Run `bug.js` to observe the error. 
5. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version.
